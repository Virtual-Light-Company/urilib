   URN Lib Todo list

 - When looking for resolvers and other dynamically loaded items the
system should keep a list of the failed ones that didn't initialise
properly so it does not attempt to keep loading them.

 - ResourceConnection should have a method that returns the
protocol type using the info from the URIConstants rather than having to either 
guess and cast or fetch the URL and then get the protocol of the URL.

 - Add a parseQuery to UriUtils method that does the same thing as HttpUtils from
the servlet area

 - Update content handling mechanism to deal with the JDK 1.3 update that
allows you to specify a Class of the type that you want returned.
