URI Class libraries
--------------------

Changes between 0.7 and 0.8
----------------------------

- Made common code section for RDSManager when finding the resolver order list.

- Added convenience method to RDSManager to query for the list of strings
that constitute the potentially available resolvers as strings.

- Updated documentation on URIResolverService method call for return value
definition being more clearly defined.

- Moved all of the resolvers, content handlers and protocol handlers to the
vlc.uri package out of org.ietf.uri. This is to minimise the package signature
under the IETF namespace and keep the implementation local to VLC.

- Removed dead code from static initialiser in File based Resolver class.

- Cleaned up > 80 column text in file.FileParser

Changes between 0.6 and 0.7
----------------------------

27 August 1999

- Modified URIUtils to use URIs for getPath and getQuery so that you don't
need to do the instanceof/cast calls anymore. Deleted old methods.

- Added event mechanism for ResourceConnection. Now you get status updates
on the download information, connection status and all sorts of good stuff
like that. Added new package org.ietf.uri.event

- Implemented content handler for alternative/multipart (sorta, doesn't
always work as advertised).

- FileResourceConnection.connect() now throws a FileNotFoundException if the
file does not exist.

- Fixed bug where the URIResourceFactory was not being set on ResolverServices
being created from a ResolverServiceFactory.

- Added new constructor to the URN class to allow creation from the component
NID and NSS without having to form a string. Fixed some doco bugs.

- Added new methods to ResolverManager and ResourceConnection to allow 
internal registration of content types with extensions. Used so that some
resource connections can make sure they get the right content type 
interpretation.

- Added platform specific filtering for Win32 to FileResourceConnection. Now
automatically strips a leading '/' and swaps '|' to ':' if needed. 

- Tested the crap out of the software. Has been used extensively within my
applications at work for the past few months in real live situations. Seems
to be holding together really well now. 

Changes between 0.5 and 0.6
----------------------------

- Rewrote the internals of URL. Now no longer delegates to java.net.URL. All
done internally.

- Added method to strip a file into path, query and reference parts to
URIUtils. Required some heavy reorganisation of URIUtils internally. Lots of
new smaller methods to do stuff.

- Added convenience method to URIUtils to take a string and return a URI
object.

- Made some changes to protocol.file.FileResourceConnection to deal with
query parts. Was handling these wrong and looking for a filename with with ?
as part of it if there was a query string.

- Added last modified time to ResourceConnection. Updated
FileResourceConnection to override this which returns File.lastModified.

- Added text/uri-list content handler

- Added simple data: protocol handler.

- Fixed bug in text/plain content handler for the read from stream. Was reading
too many characters that were being appended to the string buffer.

- HttpResourceConnection now deals with proxy information and fields for
allowing the use of cookies.

- Basic implemetation of HttpResourceConnection using Innovation HTTPClient
classes (LGPL'd) - http://www.innovation.ch/java/HTTPClient/ . Does all the
standard stuff, plus PUT/POST, but nothing special. Can fetch images etc.

- due to the nature of the HTTPClient code, this allows _very_ quick adaption
to include HTTPS and SHTTP as well. Problem is that no authentication system is
currently available (on the TBD list) so it sorta doesn't work. At least it
finds the handlers and loads them

- added x-java/jar content handler to load JAR files from a network

- added JarResourceConnection based class and implementation. JAR URLs are now
extended from the base Sun definition allowing you to describe a JAR file using
a URN as the location eg urn:x-java:myfile.jar!/someclass.class that will use
the URN system to automatically locate a JAR file.
  o Should implement a resolver type that looks in the classpath for these
  files.
  o Should implement a URNClassLoader to take advantage of this.

- Strip excess constants from URI that were in URIConstants and all the default
port stuff from URI. URI.getDefaultPort marked deprecated - to be removed in
v0.7

- error in URIUtils parsing of authority. When parsing file:/// it worked fine
but for JAR URLs that had jar:file:/// it mistakenly thought that file: was the
authority definition. It now first checks for the existance of // before
looking for the authority section.

- removed dead code in file based resolver Resolver and FileParser

- Added THTTP resolver. Only handles text/uri-list at this stage. HTML handler
to come shortly and same with redirects for N2R. Not tested yet.
