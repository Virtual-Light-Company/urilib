Events and listeners that the URI packages use.
<P>

<H2>Capabilities</H2>

The classes represent the various types of events that one can register
listeners for.
<P>

The main set of capabilities is listening for progress information about
the stream. Unlike the standard <CODE>java.net</CODE> packages you can
register for notifications of the progress of a download. For example you can
be told asyncrhonously if there was some form of error with the event
terminating or other actions. Similarly, the progress in the number of bytes
read can be given to you.
