The core libraries to provide a URI services to an application.

Three types of resources are currently managed - Filename maps, content
handlers and protocol handlers. The process for dealing with the three
are identical. There are three ways, in order of priority, for specifying
the class to use. Variations are provided below.

<OL>
<LI>Using the set handler factory.
<LI>Locating the class in the package from the defined system resource
<LI>Locating the class from a default package name
</OL>

The properties for each can be summed up as follows:
<TABLE>
<TR>
  <TH>Access type
  <TH>Factory Class
  <TH>Package list property
  <TH>Default package
</TR>
<TR>
  <TD>Filename map
  <TD>FileNameMap
  <TD>uri.filename.handler.pkgs
  <TD>org.ietf.uri.filemap
</TR>
<TR>
  <TD>Content Handlers
  <TD>ContentHandlerFactory
  <TD>uri.content.handler.pkgs
  <TD>org.ietf.uri.content
</TR>
<TR>
  <TD>Protocol Handlers
  <TD>URIResourceStreamFactory
  <TD>uri.protocol.handler.pkgs
  <TD>org.ietf.uri.protocol
</TR>
</TABLE>

In this implementation, a default handler also works with the standard
properties defined by the <CODE>java.net</CODE> package. Where this
occurs, wrapper classes are used to make sure of seemless integration.
This allows easy movement of old code to the new system with minimal
distruption.
