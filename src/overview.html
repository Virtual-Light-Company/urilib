<H1>Uniform Resource Identifier Library</H1>

Uniform Resource Identifiers (<I>URI</I>) are the parent of the more well know
Uniform Resource Locators (<I>URL</I>). This library provides a complete
implementation of both the full URI suite of functionality.
<P>

The library takes many hints from the standard <CODE>java.net</CODE> package
and the way it presents a URL class to the user. However, in my opinion, that
package misses a number of vital ingredients - the primary function being able
to listen to the download progress so common is almost every net application
(from FTP clients to web browsers). In these cases and where the overriding
URI system comes into play, the two libraries have diverged. In general it is
very close to being a pluggable replacement with only the import lines and a
couple of minor API changes needed.
<P>

<H2>Dealing with URIs</H2>

URIs are much more flexible than the Java interfaces seem to imply. There is a
sibling to URLs called Uniform Resource Names (<I>URN</I>) that gives you
naming without location information. The underlying system then resolves that
to a real location and gives you back the information. As a complement to this
you can also change URLs to URNs and back again at will. This library provides
all of these facilities.

<H2>Customisation Features</H2>

Adhering to the standard Java philosophy almost everything is replacable or
overridable within the library. There are a collection of standard behaviours
for which the user can provide expanded or different functionality.
<P>

Four areas can be configured:

<OL>
<LI>The resolver(s) to change a URL &lt;-&gt; URN &lt;-&gt; URC.
<LI>The handlers for individual network protocols like HTTP and FTP
<LI>The handlers for various content types like JPEG image and HTML text
<LI>The mapping of file names to content types
</OL>

Each of these areas can be changed in a number of ways:

<OL>
<LI>Providing a custom coded factory within the code.
<LI>Locating the class in the package from the defined system resource
<LI>Locating the class from a default package name for this library
<LI>Where available, loading the class from the java.net default areas
</OL>

For more information on the specifics of these properties, see the package
documentation for {@link org.ietf.uri}.

<H2>What's Provided</H2>

There are two main areas in this library: The core URI mechanisms and a
collection of resolvers and handlers. You will notice this in the package
names.
<P>

The core URI libs are provided in the <CODE>org.ietf.uri</CODE> package
hierarchy. These classes provide the basic capabilities of resource management,
event management, URI class representations and utilities.
<P>

A collection of resolvers and handlers are provided in the <CODE>vlc.net</CODE>
packages. These are specific implementations of Resolver Discovery Services,
protocol handlers and content handlers. Not included in this deliverable, but
also available from VLC are a set of content handlers specifically for 
loading many different <A HREF="http://www.vlc.com.au/imageloader/">image
types</A>
